      <h2>Prelude</h2>
      <p>
        In these modern days, the ability to get into a flow state and do deep
        work is becoming more rare and rare.
      </p>
      <p>
        So the new thing in this new economy to be able to succeed and show real
        value, it is by leveraging the power of deep work and applying it to our
        lives.
      </p>

      <h2>The Concept of Deep Work</h2>
      <p>
        Deeply working on a specific task for long periods of time without
        interruption, the more time i'm into deep work the more the focus is
        becoming intense (there is this rule that says that we first need to
        work for atleast 20 mins with no interruption on a task to fully be in a
        flow state).
      </p>

      <h2>What can you expect from this site ?</h2>
      <p>
        What you just read is the beginning of a long article I wrote about the
        book
        <a
          href="https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692"
          >Deep Work</a
        >
        by <i>Cal Newport</i>. This is only a very small portion of the very
        valuable article I wrote about it but once I finish reading the book you
        can expect this website getting vastly updated with a beautiful UI and
        the article fully written on the webpages.
