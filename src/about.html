      <h2>Who am I ? ðŸ˜‘</h2>
      <p>
        Hello there! I'm Vincent, a passionate student pursuing an IT degree at
        the University of Orsay. For over 2 years, I dedicated myself to
        learning to code, specifically web development. Thanks to
        <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> for
        letting this happen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I have built a couple of dozen programs, most of which are
        web applications. They are all available open source on my GitHub
        repository!
      </p>

      <h2>My Goals âš½</h2>
      <p>
        My ultimate goal is to make a living by making a start-up in the form of
        a web application or even a mobile application and generate money out of
        it, even selling websites to potential customers would make me feel
        successful.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm going through college so I can further improve my skills in web
        development but most importantly, my skills in artificial intelligence,
        as AI is getting better and better at making programs, it is important
        for me to know how to handle this tool to my advantage.
