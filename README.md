## Description

This project is part of the TOP curriculum, a project made to enhance my knowledge of node, server-side programming and debugging.

It showcases a basic informational website where I give a sneakpeek of my soon-finished Deep Work article along with some information about myself and a contact me page.

Nothing too crazy, those are just irrelevant information for developement purposes (setting up a server, manipulating urls, requests...)

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/basic-informational-site.git
- Navigate to the project directory: cd basic-informational-site
- Preview the website: node index.js

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Javascript
- **Server-side Tool**: NodeJS
